# ✅ SELF-EVALUATION TEST (Basics of Python)

## 📌 Part A — Concept Questions

1. **What is the difference between:**

```python
   print("Hello" + name)
   print("Hello", name)
```

2. What is a side effect? Give one example from Python.
3. What is the purpose of the input() function and what data type does it always return?
4. What is a variable? Write your own short definition.
5. What does .strip() do? When is it useful?
6. When using round(number[, ndigits]), what does the square bracket mean?
7. What is pseudocode and why do we use it?
8. What is an f-string? Write one advantage of using f-strings over concatenation.
9. What is the difference between .capitalize() and .title()?
10. What will .split(" ") do to this string?
    "Aryan Kumar"

### 📌 Part B — Predict the Output

11. What will this print?

```python
print("Score:", 50)
```

12. What will this print?

```python
name = "  aryan  "
print(name.strip().capitalize())
```

13. What will this print?

```python
value = 3.14159
print(f"{value:.2f}")
```

14. What will this print?

```python
num = 1000000
print(f"{num:,}")
```

15. What will this print?

```python
first, last = "Elon Musk".split(" ")
print(first)
print(last)
```

### 📌 Part C — Write the Code

16. Write code to:

- Ask the user for their name
- Remove extra spaces
- Capitalize it properly
- Print: "Welcome, <name>"

17. Write code to:

- Ask the user for a number
- Convert it to an integer
- Print the number rounded to the nearest whole number using round()

18. Write code to:

- Take a float from the user
- Print it rounded to two decimal places using an f-string.
